\s2 The descendants of Reuben
\p

\v 9 Some of them lived further east, as far as the edge of the desert south of the Euphrates River. They went there because they had a huge amount of cattle, with the result that there was not enough pastureland for them in the Gilead region.

\s5
\li1
\v 10 When Saul was king of Israel, Bela's clan fought against the descendants of Hagar and defeated them. After that, Bela's clan lived in the tents that the descendants of Hagar had lived in previously, in all the area east of the Gilead region.

\s2 The armies of the tribes that lived east of the Jordan River

\s5
\p
\v 18 There were 44,760 soldiers from the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh. They all carried shields and swords and bows and arrows. They were all trained to fight well in battles.
\v 19 They attacked the descendants of Hagar and the people of Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab cities.

\s5
\v 20 The men from those three tribes prayed to God during the battles, requesting him to help them. So he helped them, because they trusted in him. He enabled them to defeat [IDI] the descendants of Hagar and all those who were helping them.
\v 21 They took the animals that belonged to the descendants of Hagar: They took 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also captured 100,000 people.
\v 22 But many descendants of Hagar were killed because God helped the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. After that, those three tribes lived in that area until the army of Babylonia captured them and took them away to Babylon.
\s2 The eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh

\s5
\p
\v 23 There were many people who belonged to the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh. They lived in the Bashan region east of the Jordan River, as far north as Baal-Hermon, Senir, and Hermon Mountain.
\p
\v 24 Their clan leaders were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were all strong, brave, and famous soldiers, and leaders of their clans.

\s5
\v 25 But they sinned against God, the one whom their ancestors had worshiped. They began to worship the gods that the people of that region had worshiped, the people whom God had enabled them to destroy!
\v 26 So the God whom the Israelites worshiped incited Pul, the king of Assyria, to want to conquer those tribes. Pul's other name was Tiglath-Pileser. His army captured the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh, and took them to various places in Assyria: Halah, Habor, Hara and near the Gozan River. They have lived in those places from that time to the present time.

\s5
\v 25 Sometimes it was necessary for the relatives of the gatekeepers who lived in those villages to come and help them. Each time some of them came, they helped the gatekeepers for seven days.

\c 10

\p
\v 1 The army of Philistia again fought against the Israelites. The Israelite soldiers ran away from them, and many Israelites were killed  on Gilboa Mountain.
\v 2 The soldiers of Philistia caught up with Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
\v 3 The fighting was very fierce around Saul, and the archers shot Saul and wounded him severely.

\s5
\p
\v 4 Saul said to the man who was carrying his weapons, "Take out your sword and kill me with it, in order that these heathen Philistines will not be able to injure me further and make fun of me while I am dying." But the man who was carrying Saul's weapons was terrified and refused to do that. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it and died.

\s5
\p
\v 5 When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself on his own sword and died.
\v 6 So Saul and three of his sons all died, and none of his descendants ever became king.

\s5
\p
\v 7 When the Israelites who were living in the valley saw that their army had run away and that Saul and his three sons were dead, they left their towns and ran away. Then the soldiers from Philistia came and occupied those towns.
\p
\v 8 The next day, when the Philistines came to take away the weapons of the dead Israelite soldiers, they found the corpses of Saul and his three sons on Gilboa Mountain.

\s5
\v 9 They took the clothes off Saul's corpse and cut off his head and took it and Saul's armor.
\v 10 Then they sent messengers throughout their land, to proclaim the news throughout their own area, to their idols and to the other people. They put Saul's armor in the temple where their idols were, and they hung Saul's head in the temple of their god Dagon.

\s5
\p
\v 11 All the people who lived in Jabesh in the Gilead region heard what the Philistines had done to Saul's corpse.
\v 12 So the bravest men for seven days.

\s5
\p
\v 13 Saul died because he did not faithfully obey what Yahweh told him to do. He even went to a woman who talks to the spirits of dead people and asked her what he should do,
\v 14 instead of asking Yahweh what he should do. So Yahweh caused him to die, and he appointed David, the son of Jesse, to be the king of Israel.





\s5
\c 11

\p
\v 1 Then the people of Israel came to David at Hebron town and said to him, "Listen, we have the same ancestors [IDI] that you have.
\v 2 In the past, when Saul was our king, it was you who led our Israelite soldiers in our battles. You are the one to whom our God promised, 'You will be the leader  of my people; you will be their king.'~"
\p
\v 3 So all the Israelite elders came to David at Hebron. And David made a sacred agreement with them while Yahweh was listening. They anointed him with olive oil to set him apart to be the king of the Israelite people. That is what Yahweh had previously told the prophet Samuel would happen.


\s5
\p
\v 4 David and all the Israelite soldiers went to Jerusalem. At that time, Jerusalem was called Jebus, and the people who lived there were the Jebus people-group.
\v 5 They said to David, "Your soldiers will not be able to get inside our city!" But David's soldiers captured the city, even though it had strong walls around it, and since then it has been called the City of David.
\p
\v 6 What happened was this: David said to his soldiers, "The one who leads our soldiers to attack the Jebus people-group will become the commander of all my army." Joab, the son of Zeruiah, led the soldiers, so he became the commander of all the army.

\s5
\p
\v 7 After they captured the city with its strong walls around it, David moved there. That is why they named it the City of David.
\v 8 David's workers rebuilt the city, starting where the land was filled in and extending to the wall that was around the city. Joab's men repaired the other parts of the city.
\v 9 David became more and more powerful him.


\s5
\p
\v 10 Yahweh had promised that David would become the king. And all the Israelite people were happy that David was their king.
\p There were many soldiers who helped David's kingdom to remain strong.
\v 11 This is a list of David's most outstanding warriors:
\p Jashobeam was from the Hacmon clan. He was the leader of David's three most powerful soldiers. One time he fought against three hundred enemies and killed them all with his spear.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Next was Eleazar, who was the son of Dodo from the clan of Ahoh.
\v 13 One day he was with David at Pas Dammim when the soldiers of Philistia gathered there for the battle. There was a field of barley there. At first the Israelite soldiers ran away from the soldiers of Philistia,
\v 14 but then David and Eleazar stopped in the middle of the field and fought to defend it and killed many of the soldiers of Philistia. Yahweh enabled them to win a great victory on that day.

\s5
\p
\v 15 One time three of David's thirty greatest warriors came to David when he was camping next to the huge rock outside the cave near Adullam. At that same time, the army of Philistia had camped in the Rephaim Valley.
\v 16 David was in a fortress, and some of the soldiers of Philistia were occupying Bethlehem.
\v 17 One day David very much wanted some water to drink and said, "I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!"

\s5
\v 18 So the three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out on the ground to be an offering to Yahweh.
\v 19 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like  to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that David's three greatest warriors did.

\s5
\p
\v 20 Joab's younger brother Abishai was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors. One time Abishai fought three hundred enemy soldiers with his spear and killed them.
\v 21 So he became as famous as the three greatest warriors. He became their commander, even though he was not one of those three men.

\s5
\p
\v 22 Jehoiada's son Benaiah was a brave soldier from Kabzeel town who did great deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the Moab people-group. One day he went down into a pit when snow was falling on the ground and killed a lion there.
\v 23 He also killed a soldier from Egypt who was 7-1 tall. The soldier from Egypt carried a spear that was as long as a weaver's rod. Benaiah had only a club, but he grabbed the other man's spear and killed him with it.

\s5
\v 24 Those are some of the things that Benaiah did. So he became as famous as the three greatest warriors.
\v 25 He was more honored that the other members of the group of thirty great warriors, but he did not become a member of the group of three most outstanding warriors. David appointed him to be the leader of his bodyguards.

\p
\v 1 David went to Ziklag town to escape from King Saul. While he was there, many warriors came and joined him, and they helped him when he fought battles.
\v 2 They carried bows and arrows. They were able to shoot arrows and to sling stones. They could use either their right arms or their left arms to do that. They were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin.

\s5
\p
\v 3 Their leader was Ahiezer. Next in command was Joash. They were both sons of Shemaah from Gibeah city. These are the names of some of those warriors:
\li1 Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth;
\li1 Beracah;
\li1 Jehu from Anathoth town;
\li1
\v 4 Ishmaiah from the Gibeon city, who was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors;
\li1 Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah town;

\s5
\li1
\v 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph town;
\li1
\v 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam, who were descendants of Korah;
\li1
\v 7 Joelah and Zebadiah, who were sons of Jeroham, from Gedor town.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Some men from the tribe of Gad east of the Jordan River joined David when he was at his fortress in the caves in the desert. They were brave warriors who were trained for fighting battles and able to use shields and spears well. They .

\s5
\li1
\v 9 Ezer was their leader.
\li1 Next in command was Obadiah.
\li1 Next was Eliab.
\li1
\v 10 Next was Mishmannah.
\li1 Next was Jeremiah.
\li1
\v 11 Next was Attai.
\li1 Next was Eliel.
\li1
\v 12 Next was Johanan.
\li1 Next was Elzabad.
\li1
\v 13 Next was another man whose name was Jeremiah.
\li1 The last was Macbannai.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Those men from the tribe of Gad were all army officers. Some of them commanded 1,000 soldiers, and some of them commanded 100 soldiers.
\v 15 They crossed to the west side of the Jordan River during March, at the time of the year when the river was flooded. They chased from there all the people who lived in the valleys on both sides of the river.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Some other men from the tribe of Benjamin and from Judah also came to David in his fortress.
\v 17 David went out of the cave to meet them and said to them, "If you have come peacefully to help me, I am eager to have to join with me. But if you have come to enable my enemies to capture me, even though I  will see it and condemn, Or: punish you."

\s5
\p
\v 18 Then God's Spirit came upon Amasai, who was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors, and he said,
\q1 "David, we want to be with you;
\q2 you who are the son of Jesse, we will join you.
\q1 We know that things will go very well  for you and for those who are with you,
\q2 because your God is helping you."

\s5
\p
\v 19 So David welcomed those men, and he appointed them to be leaders of his soldiers. Some men from the tribe of Manasseh also joined David when he went with the soldiers of Philistia to fight against Saul's army. But David and his men did not really help the army of Philistia. After the leaders of Philistia talked about David and his soldiers, they sent David away. They said, "If David joins his master Saul again, we will all be killed !"
\v 20 When David went to Ziklag, these were the men from the tribe of Manasseh who went with him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, another man whose name was Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each of them had been a commander of 1,000 men in Saul's army.

\s5
\v 21 They were all brave soldiers, and they helped David to fight against the groups of men who roamed throughout the country, robbing people. So those men became commanders in David's army.
\v 22 Every day more men joined David's men, and his army became large, like .


\s5
\p
\v 23 These are the numbers of soldiers who were ready for battle who joined David at Hebron city. They came to help him to become the king of Israel instead of Saul, as Yahweh had promised would happen.
\li1
\v 24 There were 6,800 men from Judah, who carried shields and spears.
\li1
\v 25 There were 7,100 men from the tribe of Simeon. They were all strong warriors trained to fight battles.

\s5
\li1
\v 26 There were 4,600 men from the tribe of Levi.
\li2
\v 27 Jehoiada, who was a leader descended from Aaron, was in that group of descendants of Levi, and there were 3,700 men with him.
\li2
\v 28 Zadok, a strong young soldier, was also in that group, and there were 22 other leaders from his clan who came with him.

\s5
\li1
\v 29 There were 3,000 men from the tribe of Benjamin who were Saul's relatives. Most of them had previously wanted one of Saul's descendants to be the king.
\li1
\v 30 There were 20,800 men from the tribe of Ephraim who were all brave warriors and trained for fighting battles and famous in their own clans.
\li1
\v 31 There were 18,000 men from the half of the tribe of Manasseh that lived west of the Jordan River. They were all chosen to go and help David become the king.

\s5
\li1
\v 32 There were 200 men who were leaders from the tribe of Issachar. They always knew what the Israelites should do, and they knew the right time to do it. Their relatives were with them, commanded by their leaders.
\li1
\v 33 There were 55,000 men from the tribe of Zebulun. They were all experienced warriors and knew how to use all kinds of weapons well. They were completely loyal to David.

\s5
\li1
\v 34 There were 1,000 officers from the tribe of Naphtali. With them were 37,000 soldiers, each carrying shields and spears.
\li1
\v 35 There were 28,600 soldiers from the tribe of Dan, all trained to fight battles.

\s5
\li1
\v 36 There were 47,000 experienced soldiers from the tribe of Asher, all trained to fight battles.
\li1
\v 37 There were also 120,000 soldiers from the area east of the Jordan River who joined David. They were from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh. They had all kinds of weapons.

\s5
\p
\v 38 All those men were soldiers who volunteered to be in David's army. They came to Hebron wanting very much to enable David to be the king of all of the Israelite people.
\v 39 The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, because their families had given them food to take with them.
\v 40 Also, their fellow Israelites came from as far away as the area where the tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali lived, bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They brought a lot of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep. And throughout Israel, the people were very joyful.





\s5
\c 13

\p
\v 1 One day David talked with all his army officers. Some of them were commanders of 100 soldiers and some were commanders of 1,000 soldiers.
\v 2 Then he summoned the other Israelite leaders and said to all of them, "If it seems to you to be a good thing for us to do, and if it is what Yahweh our God wants, let's send a message to our fellow Israelites in all the areas of our country, including the priests and descendants of Levi who are living among them in their towns and in the nearby pasturelands, to come and join us,
\v 3 because we want to bring the Sacred Chest of our God back to us. While Saul was the king, we did not go to God's presence to ask him what we should do."
\v 4 All the people agreed with David, because they all thought that it was the right thing to do.

\s5
\p
\v 5 So David gathered all the Israelite people, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo-Hamath town in the north, and told them that he wanted them to help bring the Sacred Chest of God back to Jerusalem from Kiriath-Jearim city.
\v 6 David went with all the Israelite people to Baalah town, which is another name for Kiriath-Jearim, to get the Sacred Chest. The people believed that God ruled from between the statues of winged creatures that was above the lid of the Sacred Chest, and the Sacred Chest belongs to Yahweh .

\s5
\p
\v 7 The people put the Sacred Chest on a new cart and carried it from Abinadab's house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the oxen that were pulling the cart.
\v 8 David and all the Israelite people were celebrating in God's presence. They were singing with all their strength, and playing lyres, harps, tambourines, and cymbals, and blowing trumpets.

\s5
\p
\v 9 But when David's men came to the place where Kidon threshed grain, the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah reached out with his hand to prevent the Sacred Chest from falling off the cart.
\v 10 Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and as he was watching, he caused Uzzah to suddenly die there because he had put his hand on the Sacred Chest, and Yahweh had commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the Sacred Chest.
\p
\v 11 David was angry because Yahweh had punished  Uzzah. And now that place where Uzzah died is called 'The Punishment of Uzzah.'

\s5
\p
\v 12 That day, David was afraid of God. He asked himself, "How can I bring God's Sacred Chest to my city? 
\v 13 So the men with David did not take the Sacred Chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they took it to the house of Obed-Edom, who was from Gath city.
\v 14 The Sacred Chest stayed with Obed-Edom's family in his house for three months. And during that time Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom's family and everything that he owned.





\s5
\c 14

\p
\v 1 One day Hiram, the king of Tyre city, sent some messengers to David to talk about making an agreement between their countries. Then Hiram sent cedar logs, bricklayers, and carpenters to build a palace for David.
\v 2 When that happened, David knew that Yahweh had truly caused him to be the king of Israel, and that he had caused his kingdom to be greatly respected. Yahweh did this because he loved his Israelite people.

\s5
\p
\v 3 David married more women in Jerusalem, and those women gave birth to more sons and daughters for him.
\v 4 The names of the children that were born to him there in Jerusalem are Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.


\s5
\p
\v 8 When the army of Philistia heard that David has been appointed to be king of all of Israel, they went to try to capture him. But David heard that they were coming, so he and his soldiers went out to fight against them.
\v 9 The army of Philistia had attacked the people in the Rephaim Valley southwest of Jerusalem and had robbed them.

\s5
\v 10 David asked God, "Should my men and I go and attack the army of Philistia? If we go, will you enable us to defeat [IDI] them?"
\p Yahweh replied, "Yes, go, and I will enable you to defeat [IDI] them."
\p
\v 11 So David and his men went up to a town where the soldiers of Philistia were staying and defeated the soldiers of Philistia. Then David said, "God has enabled me and my soldiers to overwhelm my enemies like  'Baal-Perazim' which means 'Yahweh breaks through'.
\v 12 As the soldiers of Philistia fled, they left their idols there. So David commanded his soldiers to burn those idols.

\s5
\p
\v 13 But soon the army of Philistia attacked the people in that valley again.
\v 14 So again David prayed to God to ask him what he should do, and God replied, saying "Do not attack the army of Philistia from the front. Instead, go around them, and attack them from the rear in front of the balsam trees.

\s5
\v 15 When you hear something in the tops of the balsam trees that sounds like soldiers marching, attack them. I, God, will have gone ahead of you to enable you to defeat the army of Philistia."
\v 16 So David did what God commanded him to do, and he and his army defeated the army of Philistia, all the way from Gibeon city west to Gezer city.
\p
\v 17 So David became famous in all the nearby countries, and Yahweh caused the leaders of all the nations to be afraid of him.

\c 15

\p
\v 1 David commanded his workers to build houses for himself in Jerusalem. He also told them to set up a tent in which to put the Sacred Chest.
\v 2 He said, "Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to carry God's Sacred Chest, because they are the ones whom God chose to carry it and to serve him forever."
\p
\v 3 David summoned all the people of Israel to come to Jerusalem. He wanted the Sacred Chest of Yahweh to be put in the place that he had made for it.

\s5
\v 4 He summoned the descendants of Aaron, who was the first Supreme Priest, and the descendants of Levi.
\li
\v 5 120 descendants of Kohath, who was Levi's second son, came, with Uriel their leader.
\li1
\v 6 There were 220 descendants of Merari, Levi's third son, who came, with Asaiah their leader.

\s5
\li1
\v 7 There were 130 descendants of Gershon, Levi's first son, who came, with Joel their leader.
\li1
\v 8 Also, there were 200 people from Elizaphan's clan who came, with Shemaiah their leader.
\li1
\v 9 There were 80 people from Hebron's clan who came, with Eliel their leader.
\li1
\v 10 And there were 112 people from Uzziel's clan who came, with Amminadab their leader.

\s5
\p
\v 11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and these descendants of Levi: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
\v 12 David said to them, "You are the leaders of the clans descended from Levi. You and the other descendants of Levi must purify yourselves, in order to be able to do this special work for Yahweh. You must bring the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, the God of us Israelites, up to the place that I have made for it here in Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 13 The first time that we tried to bring it, we did not ask Yahweh how we should carry it . You descendants of Levi were not the ones who carried it, so Yahweh our God punished us."
\p
\v 14 Then the priests and the descendants of Levi performed the rituals to purify themselves, in order that it would be proper for them to do the work of carrying the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, the God of the Israelite people.
\v 15 The descendants of Levi fastened poles to the Sacred Chest so that they could carry the Sacred Chest by fastening poles to it and carrying it on their shoulders, like Moses had commanded, and like Yahweh had said that they should.

\s5
\p
\v 16 David told the leaders of the descendants of Levi to appoint some of their relatives to sing and play lyres, harps, and cymbals, and to sing joyful songs while they were carrying the Sacred Chest.
\p
\v 17 So they appointed Heman and his relatives Asaph and Ethan. Heman was the son of Joel; Asaph was the son of Berekiah. Ethan, a descendant of Merari, was Kushaiah's son.
\v 18 There was also another group of descendants of Levi who were appointed: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and two of the temple gatekeepers, Obed-Edom and Jeiel.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Heman, Asaph and Ethan sang, but also played bronze cymbals.
\v 20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played lyres.
\v 21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah played harps.

\s5
\v 22 Kenaniah, the leader of the descendants of Levi, directed the singing because he was very capable of doing that.
\p
\v 23 Berekiah and Elkanah were two of the men who guarded the Sacred Chest.
\v 24 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer were appointed to blow trumpets in front of the Sacred Chest. Obed-Edom and Jehiah also guarded the Sacred Chest.

\s5
\p
\v 25 David and the Israelite leaders and the officers who commanded 1,000 soldiers went to get the Sacred Chest. They went to bring it from Obed-Edom's house. They went very joyfully.
\v 26 God helped the descendants of Levi who carried the Sacred Chest of Yahweh; therefore David and the leaders sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams to thank him.

\s5
\v 27 All the descendants of Levi who carried the Sacred Chest, Kenaniah, the man who directed those who sang, all wore robes of fine white linen and sacred vests made of fine linen. David also wore a waistcloth made of white linen.
\v 28 So all the of Israelite people joined in bringing the Sacred Chest up to Jerusalem. They shouted, blew horns and trumpets, and played cymbals, lyres, and harps.

\s5
\p
\v 29 While they were bringing the Sacred Chest into Jerusalem, Saul's daughter Michal watched them, looking out of a window. When she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him.





\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 They brought the Sacred Chest to Jerusalem and put it inside the Sacred Tent that David had told his workers to set up. Then they brought offerings to be completely burned on the altar and offerings to enable them to maintain fellowship with God.
\v 2 When David had finished presenting all those offerings, he asked Yahweh to bless the people.
\v 3 He gave a loaf of bread, some dates, and some raisins to every Israelite man and woman who was there.

\s5
\p
\v 4 Then David appointed some of the descendants of Levi to stand in front of the Sacred Tent in which the Sacred Chest had been placed, to lead the people who worshiped and thanked and praised Yahweh, the God of the Israelite people.
\v 5 Asaph, who played the cymbals, was their leader. Zechariah was his assistant. The other descendants of Levi who helped Asaph were Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They played lyres and harps.
\v 6 Benaiah and Jahaziel were priests who blew trumpets frequently in front of the Sacred Tent in which was the Sacred Chest.


\s5
\p
\v 7 On that day, David gave to Asaph and his helpers this psalm to praise Yahweh:
\q1
\v 8 Thank God, and pray to him .
\q2 Tell the people of all nations what he has done.
\q1
\v 9 Sing to him; sing songs to praise him.
\q2 Tell about all his miraculous deeds.

\s5
\q1
\v 10 Be glad that you belong to him ;
\q2 those who want to know Yahweh better should rejoice.
\q1
\v 11 Trust in Yahweh and in his power;
\q2 continually seek to get help from him.

\s5
\q1
\v 12 Do not forget the wonderful things that he has done,
\q2 the miracles and the just laws that he has given to us.
\q1
\v 13 We people are the descendants of his servant Jacob;
\q2 we are the people of Israel whom he has chosen.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh is our God.
\q2 His just laws are known by people throughout the world.

\s5
\q1
\v 15 He never forgets the agreements that he has made;
\q2 he made a promise that will last for a thousand generations.
\q1
\v 16 That is the agreement that he made with Abraham,
\q2 and he repeated that agreement to Isaac.
\q1
\v 17 It was an agreement for the Israelite people,
\q2 and he wanted that agreement to endure forever.
\q1
\v 18 What he said was, "I will give the Canaan region to you,
\q2 to belong to you and your descendants forever."
\b

\s5
\q1
\v 19 He said that to them when there were only a few of them,
\q2 a tiny group of people who were living in that land like strangers;
\q1
\v 20 they continued to wander from one place to another,
\q2 from one kingdom to another.
\q1
\v 21 But he did not allow others to oppress them,
\q2 and he warned kings by saying to them,
\q1
\v 22 "Do not harm the people whom I have chosen!
\q2 Do not harm my prophets!"
\b

\s5
\q1
\v 23 You people throughout the world, sing to Yahweh.
\q2 Every day proclaim to others that he has saved us.
\q1
\v 24 Tell among the nations that he is great;
\q2 tell all the people-groups the marvelous things that he has done.

\s5
\q1
\v 25 Yahweh is great, and he deserves to be praised very much.
\q2 He should be revered more than all the gods,
\q1
\v 26 because all the gods that the other people-groups worship are only idols,
\q2 but Yahweh is truly great; he created the skies.
\q1
\v 27 He is glorious and majestic;
\q2 he is very powerful and joyful in his temple.
\b

\s5
\q1
\v 28 You people in nations all over the world, praise Yahweh!
\q2 Praise Yahweh for his glorious power !
\q2
\v 29 Praise Yahweh like he  deserves to be praised.
\q1 Bring an offering and come to his temple.
\q2 Worship Yahweh because he is holy.

\s5
\q1
\v 30 Everyone on the earth should tremble in front of Yahweh,
\q2 because he is majestic and holy.
\q2 He put the earth firmly in its place; and nothing ever will be able to move it.
\q1
\v 31 Everything in the sky and on the earth should be happy.
\q2 People everywhere should say, "Yahweh is our king!"

\s5
\q1
\v 32 The oceans and all the creatures that are in the oceans should shout;
\q2 the fields and everything that is in them should rejoice.
\q1
\v 33 When they do that, it will be as though the trees in the forest will sing joyfully in front of Yahweh.
\q2 That will happen when he comes to judge everyone on  the earth.
\b

\s5
\q1
\v 34 Thank Yahweh, because everything that he does is good.
\q2 He faithfully loves us forever.
\q1
\v 35 Say to him, "God, you are the one who rescues us,
\q2 so gather us together and save us from the armies of other nations.
\q1 When you do that, we will thank you ,
\q2 and we will be happy to praise you."

\s5
\q1
\v 36 Praise Yahweh, the God of us Israelite people,
\q2 He has always existed, and he will exist forever.
\m After the people finished singing that song, they all said "Amen!", and they praised Yahweh.

\s5
\p
\v 37 Then David left Asaph and the other members of his clan there in front of the tent in which Yahweh's Sacred Chest had been placed. He told them that they must do their work there every day.
\v 38 David also left Obed-Edom and 68 other descendants of Levi to work with them. Hosah and Obed-Edom guarded the entrances of the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 39 David also told Zadok the Supreme Priest and the other priests who worked with him to remain in front of Yahweh's Sacred Tent, at the place where the Israelite people worshiped God there in Gibeon city.

\s5
\v 40 Every morning and every evening they burned offerings on the altar, obeying the rules which Yahweh had given to the Israelite people.
\v 41 With them were Heman and Jeduthun and other descendants of Levi. They  were chosen to sing songs to praise Yahweh because he faithfully loves his people forever.

\s5
\v 42 Heman and Jeduthun were appointed to play the trumpets and cymbals when the other descendants of Levi sang sacred songs. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to guard the gates of the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 43 Then all the people left. They all returned to their homes, and David returned home to ask Yahweh to bless his family.





\s5
\c 17

\p
\v 1 After David began to live in his palace, he said to the prophet Nathan, "It does not seem right that I am here living in a palace made of cedar wood, but Yahweh's Sacred Chest is kept inside a tent!"
\p
\v 2 Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you are thinking about doing, do it, because God is with you."

\s5
\p
\v 3 But that night God spoke  to Nathan. He said,
\pi
\v 4 "Go and tell my servant David that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to him: 'You are not the one who should build a temple for me to live in.
\v 5 I have not lived in any building, from the day that I brought the people of Israel up out of Egypt until now. Instead, I have lived in my Sacred Tent, moving from one place to another when the Israelites moved to other places.
\v 6 Wherever I went with all the Israelites as they traveled, I never  them, "Why have you not built me a temple made of cedar wood?"~'

\s5
\pi
\v 7 Therefore, this is what you should say to my servant David: 'I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, took you from a pasture where you were taking care of sheep, and I appointed you to be the ruler of my Israelite people.
\v 8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have gotten rid of all your enemies who were in front of you. And now I will cause you to become very famous, as well-known as the names of the greatest men who have ever lived on the earth.

\s5
\v 9-10 Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israelite people, many violent groups oppressed them. But this will not happen anymore. I have chosen a place where my Israelite people can live peacefully and no one will disturb them anymore. I will give them rest from being attacked by their enemies. And I will defeat all your enemies.
\pi I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you die.

\s5
\v 11 When your life ends .
\v 12 He is the one who will arrange for a temple to be built for me. And I will enable his descendants to be kings  of Israel forever.

\s5
\v 13 I will be like a father to him, and it will be as though he is a son to me. I stopped loving Saul, the one who was the king before you became king, but I will never stop loving your son.
\v 14 I will cause him to rule over my people .'~"
\p
\v 15 So Nathan reported to David everything that Yahweh had revealed to him.


\s5
\p
\v 16 Then David went into the Sacred Tent and sat in the presence of Yahweh, and prayed this:
\pi "Yahweh my God, I am certainly not  worthy for you to have done of all these things for me, and my family is not worthy, either.
\pi
\v 17 And O God, now, in addition to everything else, you have spoken about what will happen to my descendants in the future for many generations. Yahweh my God, you have acted toward me as though I was the most important man on the earth!
\pi
\v 18 What more can I, David, say to you for honoring me? Although you know very well what I am like,

\s5
\v 19 Yahweh, for my sake and because it is what you wanted to do, you have done these great things for me, and you have revealed to me these things that you are promising to do.
\pi
\v 20 Yahweh, you are great. There is no one like you. Only you are God, which is what we have always heard.
\v 21 And there is no nation in the world like Israel . Israel is the only nation on the earth whose people you went out to rescue. You performed great and awesome miracles, rescuing our ancestors from being slaves in Egypt, expelling the people of other people-groups who were in Canaan.

\s5
\v 22 You have caused us your Israelite people to belong to you forever, and you, Yahweh, have become our God!
\pi
\v 23 And now Yahweh, I pray that you will cause the things that you have promised about me and my descendants  to be fulfilled forever, and do the things that you have said that you would do.
\v 24 When that happens, you  of mine who will rule.

\s5
\pi
\v 25 You, my God, have revealed to me that you will cause some of my descendants to become kings. So I am brave enough to pray like this to you.
\v 26 Yahweh, you are God! You have promised to do these good things for me.
\v 27 And now you, Yahweh, have promised to bless my descendants , in order that they will continue to rule forever. That will happen because you, Yahweh, are the one who has blessed them, and you will keep blessing them forever."





\s5
\c 18

\p
\v 1 Some time later, David's army attacked the army of Philistia and defeated them. They captured Gath city and the surrounding villages.
\p
\v 2 His army also defeated the army of the Moab people-group. The people were forced to accept David to be their ruler, and also to pay money each year to David's government, in order that David's army would protect them.

\s5
\p
\v 3 David's army also fought against the army of Hadadezer, the king of the Zobah region in Aram near Hamath city, when Hadadezer was trying to establish control over the area near the Euphrates River.
\v 4 David's army captured 1,000 of Hadadezer's chariots, 7,000 chariot-drivers, and 20,000 soldiers. They hamstrung most of their horses; there were only 100 horses that they did not cripple.

\s5
\p
\v 5 When the army of Aram came from Damascus city to help Hadadezer's army, David's soldiers killed 22,000 of them.
\v 6 Then David stationed groups of his soldiers in Damascus, and the people of Aram were forced to accept David to be their ruler, and to pay to David's government each year the payment that he demanded. And Yahweh enabled David's army to win battles everywhere they went.

\s5
\p
\v 7 David soldiers took the gold shields that were carried by the officers of Hadadezer's army and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 They also brought from Tebah  and Cun, two towns that belonged to Hadadezer, a lot of bronze, which David's son Solomon later used to make the huge bronze basin and the pillars and other bronze items for the temple.

\s5
\p
\v 9 When Tou, the king of Hamath city in Aram, heard that David's army had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer,
\v 10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to greet him and congratulate him about his defeating Hadadezer's army, which had been fighting the army of Tou. Hadoram brought to David many items, Or: gifts made of gold, silver, and bronze.
\p
\v 11 King David dedicated those thngs to Yahweh, like he had done with the silver and gold that his soldiers had taken from the Edom and Moab people-groups, and from the Ammon people-group and from the people of Philistia, and from the descendants of Amalek.

\s5
\p
\v 12 The army of David's army commander Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, killed 18,000 soldiers from Edom in the Salt Valley.
\v 13 Then David stationed groups of his soldiers there in Edom, and the people of Edom were forced to accept David to be their king and to pay money to David's government every year. And Yahweh enabled David's army to win battles wherever they went.


\s5
\p
\v 14 David ruled over all the Israelite people, and he always did for them what was just and fair.
\v 15 Zeruiah's son Joab was the chief army commander. Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the record-keeper.
\v 16 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the Supreme Priests. Shavsha was the official secretary.
\v 17 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ruled over the Kereth and Peleth groups who were David's bodyguards. And David's sons were his most important officials.





\s5
\c 19

\p
\v 1 Some time later, Nahash, the king of the Ammon people-group, died. Then his son Hanun became their king.
\v 2 When David heard about that, he thought to himself, "Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son." So David sent some officials there, to tell Hanun that he was sorry to hear that Hanun's father had died.
\p But when David's officials came to Hanun in the land where the Ammon people-group lived,
\v 3 the leaders of the Ammon people-group said to Hanun, "Do you think that David is really to honor your father that King David is sending these men to say that he is sorry that your father died? We think that his men have come to look around our city in order to determine how his army can conquer us."

\s5
\p
\v 4 Hanun believed what they said; so he commanded some soldiers who seized the officials whom David had sent, and shaved off their beards, and insulted them by cutting off the lower part of their robes, and then sent them away.
\p
\v 5 The officials were greatly humiliated. When David found out about what had happened to his officials, he sent some messengers to them to tell them, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown again, and then return home."

\s5
\p
\v 6 Then the leaders of the Ammon people-group realized that they had greatly insulted [IDI] David. So Hanun and some of his officials sent about 37,000 pounds of silver to hire chariots and chariot-drivers from the Aram-Naharaim, Aram-Maacah and Zobah regions northeast of Israel.
\v 7 They hired 32,000 chariots and chariot-drivers, as well as the kings of the Maacah and Tob regions and their armies. They came and set up their tents near Medeba town in Moab region. The soldiers from the Ammon people-group also marched out and stood in their positions at the entrance to their capital city, Rabbah.

\s5
\p
\v 8 When David heard about that, he sent Joab and all his army.
\v 9 The soldiers of the Ammon people-group came out of their city and lined up for battle at the entrance to their city. Meanwhile, the other kings who had come with their armies stood in their positions in the open fields.

\s5
\p
\v 10 Joab saw that there were groups of enemy soldiers in front of his troops and behind his troops. So he selected some of the best Israelite troops and put them in positions to fight against the soldiers of Aram.
\v 11 He appointed his older brother Abishai to be the commander of his other soldiers and he told them to stand in their positions in front of the army of the Ammon people-group.

\s5
\v 12 Joab said to them, "If the soldiers from Aram are too strong for us to defeat them, then your soldiers must come and help us. But if the soldiers from the Ammon people-group are too strong for you to defeat them, then my soldiers will come and help your men.
\v 13 We must be strong our God. I will pray that Yahweh will do what he considers to be good."

\s5
\p
\v 14 So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the army of Aram , and the soldiers from Aram ran away from them.
\v 15 And when the soldiers of the Ammon people-group saw that the soldiers from Aram were running away, they also started to run away from Abishai and his army, and they retreated back inside the city. So Joab and his army returned to Jerusalem.

\s5
\p
\v 16 After the leaders of the army of Aram realized that they had been defeated by the army of Israel, they sent messengers to another part of Aram on the east side of the Euphrates river, and brought troops from there to the battle area, with Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, leading them.
\p
\v 17 When David heard about that, he gathered all the Israelite soldiers, and they crossed the Jordan River. They advanced and took their battle positions to attack the army of Aram .

\s5
\v 18 But the army of Aram ran away from the soldiers of Israel. However, David's soldiers killed 7,000 of their chariot-drivers and 40,000 other soldiers. They also killed Shophach, their army commander.
\p
\v 19 When the kings who had been ruled by Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelite army, they made peace with David, and agreed to allow him to rule them.
\p So the rulers of Aram did not want to help the rulers of the Ammon people-group anymore.





\s5
\c 20

\p
\v 1 In that region, kings usually went with their armies to fight their enemies in the springtime. But the following year, David did not do that. Instead, he stayed in Jerusalem, and he sent his commander Joab to lead the army. Joab took his troops. They crossed the Jordan River and ruined the land of the Ammon people-group. Then they went to Rabbah, the capital city, and surrounded it. But David stayed in Jerusalem for a while. But later he took more troops and went to help Joab. Their armies attacked Rabbah and destroyed it.

\s5
\v 2 Then David took the crown from the head of the king of Rabbah , and it had many very valuable stones fastened to it. They also took many other valuable things from the city.
\v 3 Then they brought the people out of the city and forced them to work for their army, using saws and iron picks and axes. David's soldiers did this in all the cities of the Ammon people-group. Then David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem.


\s5
\p
\v 4 Later, David's army fought a battle with the army of Philistia, at Gezer city. During the battle Sibbecai, from Hushah clan, killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the of the Rapha giants. So the armies of Philistia were defeated.
\p
\v 5 In another battle against the soldiers of Philistia, Elhanan, the son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the younger brother of the giant Goliath from Gath town, who had a spear which was as thick as a weaver's rod.

\s5
\p
\v 6 There was another battle near Gath. A huge man was there who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was descended from the Rapha giants.
\v 7 When he made fun of the soldiers of Israel, Jonathan, the son of David's older brother Shimea, killed him.
\p
\v 8 Those were some of the descendants of the Rapha giants who had lived in Gath, who were killed  by David and his soldiers.





\s5
\c 21

\p
\v 1 Satan decided to cause the Israelite people to have trouble. So he incited David to find out how many men in Israel were able to be in the army.
\p
\v 2 So David commanded Joab and the other army commanders, "Count all the men in Israel who are able to be in the army. Start at Beersheba town in the south and go all the way to Dan city in the north. Then come back and report to me, in order that I may know how many men there are."
\p
\v 3 But Joab replied, "Your majesty, even if Yahweh allowed us to have a hundred times as many soldiers as we have now, you would  cause all the people of Israel to be guilty of sinning."

\s5
\p
\v 4 But David would not change his mind. So Joab and his soldiers went everywhere in Israel and in Judah, and counted the people. Then they returned to Jerusalem,
\v 5 and they reported to David that there were 1,100,000 men in Israel who could be in the army, and 470,000 in Judah.

\s5
\v 6 Joab did not count the men from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he was disgusted with what the king had commanded.

\p
\v 7 David's command to count the people caused God to become angry, so he told David that he had decided to punish the people of Israel.
\v 8 Then David prayed, saying, "Yahweh, what I did was very foolish. I have sinned greatly by what I have done. So now I plead with you, please forgive me."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Gad, David's prophet,
\v 10 "Go and tell this to David: 'I am allowing you to choose one of three things to punish you. I will do whichever one you choose.'~"

\s5
\p
\v 11 So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what Yahweh says: 'You can choose one of these punishments:
\v 12 three years of famine in Israel, or three months during which your armies will run away from their enemies who will attack them with swords, or three days during which I will send my angel to cause many people in the country to die because of a plague.' So, you must decide what I will say to answer Yahweh, the one who sent me."

\s5
\p
\v 13 David replied to Gad, "I am very distressed. But allow Yahweh to punish  me, because he is very merciful. Do not allow humans to punish me, because they will not be merciful."
\p
\v 14 So Yahweh sent a plague on the people of Israel, and 70,000 of them died because of it.
\v 15 And God sent an angel to destroy the people in Jerusalem by the plague. But when the angel was standing at the ground where Araunah, from the Jebus people-group, threshed grain, Yahweh saw all the suffering that the people had endured, and he was grieved. So he said to the angel, "Stop what you are doing [IDI]! That is enough [IDI]!"

\s5
\p
\v 16 David looked up and saw the angel whom Yahweh had sent, standing between the sky and the ground. The angel had a sword in his hand that was pointed toward Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of the city, who were wearing clothes made of rough sackcloth, prostrated themselves on the ground.
\p
\v 17 David said to God, "I am  done anything that is wrong. So Yahweh my God, punish [IDI] me and my family, but do not allow this plague to continue to cause your people to become sick and die."

\s5
\p
\v 18 Then the angel who was sent by Yahweh told Gad to go up to the place where Araunah threshed grain and tell David to build an altar to worship Yahweh there.
\v 19 So after Gad told David, he obeyed the message that Yahweh  had given to Gad, and he went up there.
\p
\v 20 While Araunah was threshing some wheat, he turned and saw the angel. His four sons who were with him also saw the angel, and they hid themselves.

\s5
\v 21 Then David approached. When Araunah saw him, he left the place where he was threshing grain and prostrated himself, with his face touching the ground.
\p
\v 22 David said to him, "Please sell me this place for threshing in order that I can build an altar here to worship Yahweh, in order that he will stop this plague. I will pay the full price."

\s5
\p
\v 23 Araunah replied, "Take it! Your majesty, do whatever you want to. I will give you the oxen that thresh the grain for an offering to be completely burned on the altar. And I will give you the threshing boards to use as wood on the altar, and I will give you flour for a flour offering. I will give all those things to you."
\p
\v 24 But the king said to Araunah, "No, I will not take these things as a gift. I will pay you the full price for it. I will not take what belongs to you, and offer sacrifices that have cost me nothing and offer them to Yahweh to be completely burned on the altar."

\s5
\p
\v 25 So David paid to Araunah 600 pieces of gold for the whole area.
\v 26 David built an altar to worship Yahweh there, and he offered sacrifices to be completely burned on the altar and sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh. David prayed to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered by sending a fire from heaven to burn up the offerings on the altar.
\p
\v 27 Then Yahweh spoke to the angel, and told him to put his sword back into its sheath. So the angel did that.

\s5
\v 28 And when David saw that Yahweh had answered him there at the place where Araunah threshed grain and had ended the plague, he offered sacrifices there.
\v 29 Yahweh's Sacred Tent, which Moses had commanded to be set up in the desert, and the altar for burning sacrifices completely, were at that time on a hill at Gibeon city.
\v 30 But David did not want to go there to request God to tell him what he wanted David to do, because he was afraid that the angel sent from Yahweh might strike him with his sword.





\s5
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then David said, "Here, at the edge of Jerusalem, is where we will build the temple for our God Yahweh, and where we will make the altar for burning the offerings that the Israelite people will bring."

\p
\v 2 So David commanded that the foreigners who lived in Israel must gather together. When they did that, he appointed some of those men to cut huge stones from the quarries and to smooth their surfaces, to be used to build the temple of God.

\s5
\v 3 David provided a large amount of iron for making nails and hinges for the doors in the gates of the temple. He also provided a huge amount of bronze for making various utensils; and because there was a huge amount of it, no one could weigh it all.
\v 4 He also provided money for buying a large amount of cedar logs. Because there was a huge number of them, no one counted them. Those were logs that men from Tyre and Sidon cities sent to David.
\p
\v 5 David provided all those things because he thought, "My son Solomon is still young and he does not know what he needs to know about building buildings, and the temple of Yahweh must be magnificent. It must be a glorious building that will become famous, and people throughout the world must consider it to be glorious, Or: splendid. So now I will begin to prepare for it to be built, and Solomon will be responsible for finishing it." So David collected a great amount of building materials before he died.

\s5
\p
\v 6 Then David summoned his son Solomon, and told him that he should arrange for a temple to be built for Yahweh, the God whom the Israelites worshiped.
\v 7 He said to him, "I wanted [IDI] to build a temple to honor  Yahweh, my God.
\v 8 But Yahweh told a prophet to tell me, 'You have killed many men .

\s5
\v 9 But you will have a son who will be king of Israel after you die. He will be a man who is peaceful and quiet, not a man who kills others. And I will cause that there will be peace between him and his enemies who are in all the nearby lands. His name will be Solomon, which sounds like the word for peace. During the time that he is king, people in Israel will be peaceful and safe.
\v 10 He is the one who will arrange for a temple to be built to honor me .'

\s5
\p
\v 11 So now, my son, I hope that Yahweh will help you, and enable you to be successful in arranging for building the temple of Yahweh, your God, which is what he said that you would do.
\v 12 I also hope that he will enable you to be wise and to understand what you need to know, and enable you to obey his laws while you rule over Israel.
\v 13 If you carefully obey all the laws and regulations and courageous. Do not be afraid of anything, and do not become discouraged!

\s5
\p
\v 14 I have tried hard to provide materials for building the temple of Yahweh. I have provided nearly 4,000 tons of gold, and nearly 40,000 tons of silver. I have also provided a very large amount of iron and bronze; no one has been able to weigh it all. I have also gathered lumber and stone for the walls of the temple, but you may need to get some more of those things.

\s5
\v 15 There are many men in Israel who have good ability to cut big stones for making stone walls, and carpenters, and men who are very skilled at making various kinds of things.
\v 16 There are many men who know how to make things from gold and silver and bronze and iron. So now I say to you, begin the work of building the temple, and I hope with you."

\s5
\p
\v 17 Then David commanded that all the Israelite leaders must assist Solomon. He said to them,
\v 18 "Yahweh our God is certainly with. He has enabled my army to conquer [IDI] them, so now Yahweh and my people control them.
\v 19 Now you must obey Yahweh with your entire inner beings. Help Solomon to arrange for building the temple for Yahweh God, in order that you can bring the Sacred Chest that contains the Ten Commandments and the other sacred items that belong to God into the temple that you will build to honor Yahweh."





\s5
\c 23

\p
\v 1 David was a very old man  when he appointed his son Solomon to be the next king.
\p
\v 2 David gathered the leaders of Israel and the priests and other descendants of Levi.
\v 3 He commanded some of his officials to count the descendants of Levi who were at least thirty years old, and they found out that there were 38,000 of them.

\s5
\v 4 Then David said, "From those 38,000 men, I want 24,000 of them to supervise the work at the temple of Yahweh, and I want 6,000 of them to be officials and judges.
\v 5 I want 4,000 to be guards at the gates, and 4,000 to praise Yahweh, using the musical instruments that I have provided for them."
\p
\v 6 David divided the descendants of Levi into three groups; each group consisted of men who were descendants of one of the three sons of Levi–Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\s2 The descendants of Gershon
\m

\s5
\v 7 From the descendants of Gershon there were Ladan and Shimei.
\li1
\v 8 There were three sons of Ladan: Jehiel was the oldest, and his younger brothers Zetham and Joel.
\li1
\v 9 There were three of the sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.
\li2 They were all leaders of the clans of Ladan.

\s5
\li1
\v 10 There were four men who were other sons of Shimei:
\li2
\v 11 Jahath, who was his oldest son, and his younger brothers Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah.
\li2 Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as though they were one family.
\s2 The descendants of Kohath
\m

\s5
\v 12 Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
\li1
\v 13 There were two sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses.
\li2 Aaron and his descendants were set apart to dedicate the very holy things, to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, to serve in his presence, and to declare to the people what Yahweh  would do to bless them. They were to do those things forever.
\li2
\v 14 The sons of Moses, the man who served God well, were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.

\s5
\li1
\v 15 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.
\li2
\v 16 The oldest son of Gershom was Shubael.
\li2
\v 17 Rehabiah was the oldest son of Eliezer.
\li2 Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many sons.
\li1
\v 18 The oldest son of Izhar was Shelomith.

\s5
\li1
\v 19 Hebron had four sons.
\li2 Jeriah was his oldest son, and his younger brothers were Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam.
\li1
\v 20 Uzziel had two sons.
\li2 Micah was the oldest son, and his younger brother was Isshiah.
\s2 The descendants of Merari
\m

\s5
\v 21 Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi.
\li2 The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.
\li2
\v 22 Eleazar had no sons; he had only daughters. So their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
\li1
\v 23 The three sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 24 Those were the descendants of Levi, whose names were listed according to their families. Each person who was at least twenty years old was listed. They all worked in the temple of Yahweh.
\v 25 David had said previously, "Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelite people belong, has enabled us to have peace, and he has come to live in Jerusalem forever.
\v 26 Therefore, the descendants of Levi no longer need to carry the Sacred Tent and the items used in the work there."

\s5
\v 27 Obeying the final instructions of David before he died, instructions for doing this work at the temple, they counted only the descendants of Levi who were at least twenty years old.
\p
\v 28 The work of those descendants of Levi was to assist the descendants of Aaron in their work in the temple of Yahweh: to be in charge of the temple courtyards and the side rooms, the ceremonies for purifying all the sacred things, and to do other work at the temple.
\v 29 They were also in charge of the loaves of bread on display before God, the loaves that were placed each week on the table in the temple, the flour for the flour offerings, the wafers that were made without yeast, and the measuring the ingredients and mixing them and baking that bread and those wafers.

\s5
\v 30 They were also told to stand every morning at the temple and thank Yahweh and praise him. They were also required to do the same thing every evening.
\v 31 And they were to do the same thing whenever offerings that were to be completely burned on the altar were presented to Yahweh on Sabbath days and during the new moon celebrations and other religious festivals. They were told how many of them should be there and what they should do each time.

\s5
\p
\v 32 So the descendants of Levi did the work that was assigned to them by their fellow Israelites who were descendants of Aaron. They did that work at the Sacred Tent and in the holy place inside the tent, and later at the temple.





\s5
\c 24

\p
\v 1 These are the groups of the descendants of Aaron the first Supreme Priest: Aaron's four sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\p
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father died, and they had no children. So their younger brothers Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
\v 3 Zadok, who was a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech, who was a descendant of Ithamar, helped David to separate the family groups into two groups. Each group had certain duties.

\s5
\v 4 There were more leaders among the descendants of Eleazar than there were among the descendants of Ithamar. So they appointed sixteen leaders from Eleazar's descendants and eight leaders from Ithamar's descendants.
\v 5 There were temple officials and priests who were there, including descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar, to make sure that the work was divided fairly. So they decided what work each group would do by casting lots.

\s5
\p
\v 6 Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, who was a descendant of Levi, wrote down the names of the leaders of each group while David and his officials were watching. Zadok, the Supreme Priest, and Ahimelech his assistant, and the leaders of the families of the priests and of the families of the other descendants of Levi also watched.
\b

\s5
\li1
\v 7 Jehoiarib was the first one whose name was selected by casting lots.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Those were the men who were chosen to be the leaders of the groups that would serve in the temple, obeying the regulations that were set down by Aaron, regulations which Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelite people belong, had given to him.

\m

\s5
\v 20 This is a list of some of the other descendants of Levi:
\li1 From the sons of Amram there was Shubael.
\li2 From the sons of Shubael there was Jehdeiah.
\li1
\v 21 From Rehabiah the son of Eleazar there was Isshiah, his oldest son.

\li2
\v 30 The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
\b
\p Those were descendants of Levi who were listed according to the leaders of their families.
\v 31 The jobs they would do were decided by casting lots while King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the leaders of he families of the priests and the descendants of Levi watched. The jobs that were given to the families of each oldest brother and each youngest brother were equal.





\s5
\c 25

\p
\v 1 David and some of the temple officials  chose some of the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to be in charge of the preaching, and to play harps and lyres and cymbals. This is a list of the men whom they chose for that work:
\li
\v 2 From the sons of Asaph they chose Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Aserelah. Asaph supervised them. And the king appointed Asaph to preach.
\li
\v 3 From the sons of Jeduthun they chose six men: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. Jeduthun supervised them and also preached, playing his harp while he thanked and praised Yahweh.

\v 5 They were all sons of Heman, who was King David's prophet. God promised to cause Heman to be strong, so altogether, God have him fourteen sons and three daughters.

\s5
\p
\v 6 All those men were supervised by their fathers while they played music in the temple of Yahweh. They played cymbals, lyres, and harps. And their fathers–Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman–were supervised by the king.
\v 7 Those men and their relatives were all trained and skilled for playing musical instruments in the temple. That was their work for Yahweh. Including their relatives, there were 288 of them.
\v 8 All of them, including ones who were young and those who were old, cast lots to determine what work they would do.
\b

\li1 From the descendants of Korah, there was Meshelemiah, the son of Kore, who was one of the sons of Asaph.
\li2
\v 2 The oldest son of Meshelemiah was Zechariah. His other sons were Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel,

\v 4 Another guard was Obed-Edom.
\li2 His oldest son was Shemaiah. His other sons were Jehozabad, Joah, Sacar, Nethanel,
\v 5 Ammiel, Issachar, and Peullethai. It was because God had blessed him that he had many sons.
\li2
\v 6 Obed-Edom's son Shemaiah also had sons. They were leaders in their father's family because they were capable of doing many things well.

\s5
\li2
\v 7 The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad. Shemaiah's relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also capable men.
\li2
\v 8 All of those descendants of Obed-Edom and their sons and relatives were capable people and strong workers. Altogether there were 62 of them.
\li1

\v 11 Hosah's other sons were Hilkiah, Tabaliah, and Zechariah. Altogether there were 13 sons and relatives of Hosah.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Those men were leaders of the groups of men who guarded the gates of the temple. They worked at the temple like their relatives did.
\v 13 By casting lots, the leader of each family chose one gate for their group to guard. All of them, including young men and old men , cast lots.
\li1
\v 14 Shelemiah's group was selected to guard the East Gate.
\li1 The group of Shelemiah's son Zechariah, who was a wise counselor, was selected to guard the North Gate.

\s5
\li1
\v 15 Then Obed-Edom's group was selected to guard the South Gate, and his sons were selected to guard the entrances to the temple storerooms.
\li
\v 16 Then Shuppim's group and Hosah's group were selected to guard the West Gate and the Shalleketh Gate on the upper road to the temple.
\p The work for the guards was divided evenly.

\s5
\v 17 Each day there were six descendants of Levi who guarded the East Gate, four who guarded the North Gate, four who guarded the South Gate, and two at a time who guarded the entrances to the storerooms.
\v 18 At the West gate there were two men who guarded the courtyard and four who guarded the road outside the courtyard.
\p
\v 19 Those were the groups of men who were descendants of Korah and Merari who guarded the gates of the temple.


\s5
\p
\v 20 Other descendants of Levi were in charge of the chests that contained the money that was dedicated to Yahweh, money that the people brought to the temple.
\p
\v 21 One of those men was Ladan, a descendant of Gershon. He was the ancestor of several family groups. Jehiel was the leader of one of those family groups.
\v 22 Others who had that work were Zetham and his younger brother Joel, who were the sons of Jehiel.

\s5
\p
\v 23 Others who did that work were descendants of Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
\li1
\v 24 Shubael, a descendant of Moses's son Gershom, was the leader who was in charge of the money chests.

\s5
\v 26 Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of all the valuable things that had been dedicated to Yahweh by King David, by the leaders of the family groups, by the army commanders of 1,000 soldiers and commanders of 100 soldiers, and by other army commanders.
\v 27 Some of the things that those army officers had taken from Israel's enemies in battles they dedicated for the repair of the temple of Yahweh.
\v 28 And Shelomith and his relatives were also in charge of everything that had been dedicated to Yahweh by the prophet Samuel, by King Saul, and by David's two army commanders Ner and Joab.
\li1

\s5
\v 29 From the descendants of Izhar, Kenaniah and his sons were given work outside the temple area. They were officials and judges in various places in Israel.
\li1
\v 30 From the descendants of Hebron, Hashabiah and his relatives were responsible for the work done for Yahweh and for the king in all the area west of the Jordan river. There were 1,700 of them who were able to do their work well.

\s5
\v 31 It was written in the records of the descendants of Hebron that Jeriah was their leader. When David had been ruling for almost forty years, they searched in those records, and they found names of capable men descended from Hebron who were at Jazer city in the Gilead region.
\v 32 Jeriah had 2,700 relatives who were able to do their work well, and who were leaders of their families. King David put them in charge of governing the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the western half of the tribe of Manasseh, to be sure that all the people did what God and the king told them to do.





\s5
\c 27

\p
\v 1 This is a list of the Israelite men who served the king in the army. Some were leaders of families, some were commanders of 100 men, some were commanders of 1,000 men, and some were other officers. There were 24,000 men  in each group. Each group served one month of each year.

\v 23 David did not tell Joab to count the men who were less then twenty years old, because Yahweh had promised many years previously that there would be as many people in Israel as there are stars in the sky.
\v 24 Joab and his helpers started to count the men of Israel, but they did not finish counting them because Joab knew that Yahweh was angry about their being counted. Yahweh punished  the people of Israel because of this counting, and as a result the total number of Israelite men able to serve in the army was not written on the scroll about King David's rule.

\c 28

\p
\v 1 David summoned all the leaders of Israel to come to Jerusalem. He summoned the leaders of the tribes, the leaders of the groups that worked for the king, the commanders of 100 soldiers, the commanders of 1,000 soldiers, those who were in charge of the king's property and his livestock, those who taught his sons, all the palace officials, and his mighty soldiers and bravest warriors.

\s5
\p
\v 2 David stood up and said, "My fellow Israelites, listen to me. I wanted [IDI] to build a temple to be a place where we would put the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, where it would stay permanently. And I made plans to build it.
\v 3 But God said to me, 'You are not the one who will arrange to build a temple for me  in battles.'

\s5
\p
\v 4 But Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, had chosen me and my descendants to be the kings of Israel forever. First he chose the tribe of Judah, and from the people  of Judah he chose my family, and from my father's sons he chose me to be the king over all of Israel.
\v 5 Yahweh has given me many sons, but from them he chose my son Solomon to be the next king to rule  his kingdom of Israel.

\s5
\v 6 He said to me, 'Solomon your son is the one who will arrange to build my temple and the courtyards around it, because I have chosen him to be like my son and I will be like  his father.
\v 7 I will enable his kingdom to endure forever if he continues to obey my laws and commands, like you are doing now.'

\s5
\p
\v 8 So now, while all you people of Israel, all of you who belong to Yahweh, are watching, and while God is listening, I command you leaders to carefully obey all the commands of Yahweh our God, in order that you may continue to possess this good land and enable your descendants to inherit it forever.

\s5
\p
\v 9 And you, my son Solomon, must know God like I know him, and you must serve him faithfully and because you want to. You must do that because he knows what everyone is thinking and he understands the reasons that people do what they do. If you seek to know him, he will heed your prayers. But if you abandon you forever.
\v 10 Yahweh has chosen you to arrange to build a temple for him. So think about what I have said, and be strong and do what he is wanting you to do."

\s5
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to his son Solomon the scroll on which were written the plans for the main rooms of the temple, its porch, its storerooms, all the other upper and lower rooms, the Holy Place, and the Very Holy Place having the sacred chest and its lid.
\v 12 David wrote for him the plans that God's Spirit had put into his mind for building the courtyards and all the rooms that surrounded the temple, including the room where the money and other valuable things that were dedicated to God were kept.

\s5
\v 13 He gave Solomon instructions for the groups of priests and other descendants of Levi, about all the work that they must do to serve in Yahweh's temple, and about taking care of all the things that would be used in the work at the temple.
\v 14 He wrote down how much gold and how much silver should be used to make all the items in the temple:
\v 15 how much gold for making the gold lampstands and the lamps, how much silver to make the silver lamps and lampstands,

\s5
\v 16 how much gold for making the table on which the priests would put the bread to display before God, how much silver to make the other tables,
\v 17 how much pure gold for the meat forks and the bowls and the cups, how much gold for each gold dish, how much silver for each silver dish,

\s5
\v 18 and how much pure gold to make the altar for burning incense. He also gave to Solomon his plans for making the golden statues of winged creatures that would be above the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, like a chariot for him.
\p
\v 19 Then David said, "I have written all these plans while Yahweh was directing  me. He has enabled me to understand all the details of his plan for the temple that is to be built."

\s5
\p
\v 20 David also said to his son Solomon, "Be strong and courageous, and do this work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, because Yahweh our God will be with you. He will not fail to help you or abandon you until you finish all the work of making the temple of his.
\v 21 The groups of priests and other descendants of Levi are ready to begin their work at the temple, and every man who has a special skill will help you in all the work. And my officials and the other people will obey you, whatever you command them to do."





\s5
\c 29

\p
\v 1 Then King David said to all the people who had gathered there, "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen to be the next king, is young and does not have much experience. This work of building the temple is great, because this glorious building will not be to honor people, but to honor Yahweh our God.
\v 2 From all the things that I possess, I have provided what will be needed to build the temple of my God–the gold for the things to be made of gold, the silver for the things to be made of silver, bronze for the things to be made of bronze, iron for the things to be made of iron, wood for the things to be made of wood, and large amounts of onyx and turquoise and other valuable stones of various colors, and marble and all kinds of valuable stones.

\s5
\v 3 In addition to all these things that I have given for the temple, I am giving my own treasures of gold and silver, because I very earnestly desire that this holy temple for my God be built.
\v 4 I am giving 110 tons of gold from Ophir and 260 tons of refined silver to cover the walls of the buildings,
\v 5 for making the other items of gold and silver, and for the other work to be done by the craftsmen. So now, I ask you, who is willing to show by contributing other gifts for the building of the temple  that he has dedicated himself to Yahweh?"

\s5
\p
\v 6 Then the leaders of the families.
\v 7 For the work at the temple they gave 190 tons and 185 pounds of gold, 375 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 3,750 tons of iron.

\s5
\v 8 And any people who owned valuable stones gave them to be put in the storeroom of the temple. Jehiel, a descendant of Gershon, was appointed to be in charge of them.
\v 9 The people were happy to see that their leaders wanted to give those things; they were happy and enthusiastic to give those things to Yahweh. And King David also was very happy.


\s5
\p
\v 10 Then, while all the people there were listening, David prayed. He said,
\q1 "We praise you, Yahweh,
\q2 the God whom our ancestor Jacob worshiped.
\q2 We will praise you forever!
\q1
\v 11 You alone are great and powerful;
\q2 only you are truly glorious and majestic and wonderful.
\q2 And that is true because everything in heaven and on the earth is yours.
\q1 You are the king of all the people in this world;
\q2 you are the ruler of everything.

\s5
\q1
\v 12 Because you are very powerful ,
\q2 you are able to cause anyone to be great and be strong.
\q1
\v 13 So now, our God, we thank you,
\q2 and we praise you  for being very great.

\s5
\p
\v 14 But I and my people are not really able to give anything to you,
\q2 because everything that we have comes from you,
\q2 and what we have given to you are only the things that we have received from you .
\q1
\v 15 We are like  foreigners and strangers to you, like our ancestors were.
\q2 Our years a shadow that disappears quickly;
\q2 we know that there is nothing that can enable us to escape dying.

\s5
\q1
\v 16 Yahweh our God, we have gathered all these things to use in building your  temple,
\q2 but all of it really belongs to you, and you have given it to us .
\q1
\v 17 My God, I know that you test us people,
\q2 and you are pleased if you find out that we do what is right.
\q1 All these things I have given to you because I wanted to.
\q2 And now I have seen that your people have joyfully and generously given things to you.

\s5
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worshiped,
\q2 I desire that your people will continue to desire to do things like this forever,
\q2 and that they will always be loyal to you.
\q1
\v 19 And now, please enable my son Solomon to faithfully and sincerely 
\q2 and to do everything that is needed to build this beautiful building
\q2 for which I have provided all these things."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Then David said to all the people who were gathered there, "Praise Yahweh our God!" So they all praised Yahweh the God whom their ancestors also worshiped. They prostrated themselves on the ground in front of Yahweh and in front of the king.

\p
\v 21 The next day the people offered sacrifices to Yahweh. They presented many animals to be completely burned on the altar: A thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand male sheep, offerings of wine, and many other sacrifices for all the people of Israel.

\s5
\v 22 On that day the people were joyful and ate and drank while Yahweh was watching.
\p Then for the second time they declared that Solomon was now the king. While Yahweh was watching, they anointed him with olive oil to be the king, and they anointed Zadok to be the Supreme Priest.
\v 23 So Solomon sat on the throne because Yahweh has wanted him to be the king to succeed his father David. During the following years Solomon prospered, and all the Israelite people obeyed him.

\s5
\v 24 King David's other sons and all the officers and mighty warriors accepted Solomon to be their king, and they solemnly promised to obey him.
\p
\v 25 Yahweh caused Solomon to be highly respected by all the Israelite people, and they honored him very much. No king of Israel was honored as much as Solomon was.


\s5
\p
\v 26 Jesse's son David was the king who ruled all of Israel.
\v 27 He ruled for forty years: seven years in Hebron city and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\v 28 He was very rich and very much honored , and he became an old man. Then he died, and his son Solomon became the king of Israel.
\p
\v 29 A record of all the things that King David did while he ruled, from the beginning to the end, was on scrolls written by the prophets Samuel, Nathan, and Gad.
\v 30 They told about his powerful rule , and all the things that happened to him and to the people of Israel and in the kingdoms of other countries while he was ruling Israel.
